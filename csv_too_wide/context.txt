"This CSV is very wide, very wide, very very wide. I need it for my research, at least 30 columns side by side. In rows and columns, data flows, A wide CSV, where knowledge grows.

From left to right, the fields expand, A digital map, a data land. Numbers, text, and dates align, In structured form, they intertwine.

Each cell a story, each row a tale, In this vast sheet, details prevail. Headers bold, they guide the way, Through endless data, night and day.

A spreadsheet wide, with secrets deep, In its embrace, the answers sleep. From A to Z, and further still, A CSV’s width, a coder’s thrill."
